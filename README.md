## Scientific Proof

DarkScience was designed with scientific research on eye strain and color perception in mind. According to studies, blue light can contribute to eye strain and disrupt sleep patterns. EyeEase reduces the amount of blue light emitted by the screen by using warmer, less intense colors for certain elements of the color scheme.

Additionally, DarkScience uses high-contrast colors to make it easier for the eyes to distinguish between different elements on the screen. This reduces the amount of eye movement required and can help to prevent eye strain and fatigue.
